This is a microfrontend application using Hilla


It can currently be run as:
1. Use the location rules from frontend-proxy/default.conf with a locally installed nginx
2. Run `npm run build && npm run serve" in the `components` folder
3. Run `mvn` in the `room-info` folder
4. Run `mvn` in the `app` folder
5. Open http://localhost:1234/ (assumes nginx runs on port 1234)
